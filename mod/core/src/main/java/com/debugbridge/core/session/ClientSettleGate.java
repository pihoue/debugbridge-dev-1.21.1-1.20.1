/**
 * Defers an action until the client has "settled" — no loading overlay covering
 * the game. Connecting to a server while a resource reload is in flight (the
 * startup reload in particular: the bridge port opens seconds before it
 * finishes) makes the server-resource-pack application — itself a resource
 * reload — collide with the in-flight one ("Reload already ongoing, replacing"
 * in the log), and the pack silently never applies. On servers whose gameplay
 * depends on pack content (custom particle textures, fonts) that wedges the
 * session hard enough that only a process kill recovers it.
 *
 * <p>{@link #runWhenSettled} polls the settled check on the game thread every
 * {@code pollIntervalMs} until it has held for {@code requiredSettledPolls}
 * consecutive polls (margin past the overlay fade-out), then runs the action on
 * the game thread. The calling (request) thread blocks until the action ran, so
 * the bridge response is truthful: success means the connect actually started,
 * and a stuck overlay surfaces as a timeout error instead of a join that
 * silently never happens.
 *
 * <p>Re-scheduling hops through a background scheduler thread instead of
 * re-enqueueing directly from inside the game-thread task: the game thread
 * drains its task queue until empty each frame, so a task that re-submits
 * itself would spin within a single frame and the overlay could never finish.
 *
 * <p>A newer call supersedes a pending one: the older caller gets an error and
 * its action never runs.
