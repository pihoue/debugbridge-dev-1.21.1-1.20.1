/**
 * Kernel-side orchestrator for {@code record_video} requests. One instance per
 * mod; created by {@code AbstractDebugBridgeMod} with a version-specific
 * {@link FrameCapturer} injected.
 *
 * <p>Lifecycle:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>The websocket handler thread calls {@link #record(RecordingRequest)},
 *       which installs a {@link RecordingSession} under {@link #active} and
 *       blocks on its future.
 *   <li>The version's render-tick mixin pumps {@link #onRenderFrame()} every
 *       frame. Each call delegates to the active session (if any).
 *   <li>When the session completes (success or failure), it clears
 *       {@link #active}, completes the future, and the handler thread
 *       continues.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Only one recording at a time. A second {@link #record} call while one is
 * active throws {@link RecordingException.Busy}.
